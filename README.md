# RSA-SvI-not_very_adj
Code to fit the RSA-SvI model to data from Leffel et al (2019) on the "not very ADJ" construction.

The file [RSA-SvI-main.Rmd](RSA-SvI-main.Rmd) contains all the code, and (RSA-SvI-main.pdf)[RSA-SvI-main.pdf] is the knitted output.

I have saved draws from the large Stan models to avoid having to fit the models again, but they are too big for github (1Gb total, about 36Mb per file). Contact me if you want them.
